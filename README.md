 # What is the difference between block and inline elements ?
  # block-level element
   always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.

A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
Two commonly used block elements are:
* **p**
* **div**.

The **P** element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.

The  **div** element defines a division or a section in an HTML document.
   

 # **Inline Elements**  

An inline element does not start on a new line.

An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.
